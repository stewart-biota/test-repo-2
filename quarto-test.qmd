## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Let's git going

## Overview

There are two steps here for the new user, firstly getting comfortable with git itself, then Github, what the differences are, and why they are useful. The second is more technical and it's understanding how to apply the git and github workflow with RStudio. By the time you're finished, you should have RStudio linked to your Github account, and be able to push and pull commits from Github within RStudio - but let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
