##Overview

There are two steps here for the new user, firstly getting comfortable with git itself, then Github, what the differences are, and why they are useful. 

The second is more technical and it's understanding how to apply the git and github workflow with RStudio. By the time you're finished, you should have RStudio linked to your Github account, and be able to push and pull commits from Github within RStudio - but let's not get ahead of ourselves here. 

##First step - wtf is git/github

Watch this video: 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
