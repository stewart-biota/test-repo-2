# Let’s git going

## Overview

There are two steps here for the new user, firstly getting comfortable
with git itself, then Github, what the differences are, and why they are
useful.

The second is more technical and it’s understanding how to apply the git
and github workflow with RStudio. By the time you’re finished, you
should have RStudio linked to your Github account, and be able to push
and pull commits from Github within RStudio - but let’s not get ahead of
ourselves here.

## First step - wtf is git/github

## Second step - connecting R and git

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](Untitled_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
